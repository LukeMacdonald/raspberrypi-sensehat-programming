With the data that you have in the database, what kind of data visualisation graph should be used?
There are two types of data visualisation graphs that should be used to represent the data collected from the sense hat
from Task A.

The line graph is the first graphÂ option used. Due to its inherent characteristics, this style of graph is especially well-suited 
for representing data gathered over time. A line graph excels in clearly and simply presenting temporal trends, patterns, and changes 
for interpretation. It uses the visual coherence of a line joining data points to effectively illustrate how the data has changed over 
the course of the recording period.

The second graph used is a bar chart. Bar charts are effective at displaying data that has been divided into separate groups or categories. 
They are a good option when working with discrete data segments because they offer a clear visual representation of the distribution of 
values across various categories.

What should be represented in the above graph? Why did you make that decision?
The measured temperature and humidity variations over the time period will be represented visually by a line graph. This is because it 
is simple to spot patterns, trends, and changes in temperature and humidity over time by using a line graph.

The distribution of data within predefined categories will be shown on the bar chart. For example, the bar chart will clearly show the 
total number of normal, hot, and cold temperature and normal, dry, and wet humidity categories. With this method, it is easy to see 
how the obtained data is distributed among these several circumstances.

Python supports numerous data visualisation libraries. Which two libraries did you narrow it down to?
There are several different data visualisation libraries for Python. After reducing the options, Matplotlib and Seaborn emerged as 
two popular libraries for displaying the Sense HAT data. In the Python community, these libraries are well known and frequently used 
for creating interesting and useful data visualisations. These tools are excellent choices for producing informative graphical representations 
of the gathered data due to their adaptability, simplicity of use, and extensive functionality.

Analytical comparison of the libraries used:
Matplotlib
Advantages:
- Matplotlib offers a vast variety of plot types, from basic line and scatter plots to more complex visualizations like heatmaps, bar charts, and 3D plots.
- The seamless integration of data analysis and visualisation is made possible by Matplotlib's great compatibility with other libraries and frameworks like NumPy and Pandas.
- Matplotlib can save plots in different formats, such as PNG, PDF, SVG, and more.
Disadvantages:
- Compared to other libraries, the plots may not be as visually pleasing.
- Code for creating complex plots can be verbose and repetitive.
Simplicity/Complexity:
Although Matplotlib offers a vast range of capability, its low-level structure makes it more difficult to use for straightforward tasks. 
Flexibility/Configurations:
With its great versatility, Matplotlib enables users to precisely manipulate every element of a plot. 
- When designing detailed visualisations, this high level of flexibility might result in complex settings.
Seaborn
Advantages:
- Uses the least amount of code possible to deliver visually appealing and educational visualisations.
- Easy to learn for beginners.
- Supports various types of plots.
Disadvantages:
- Limited customization options compared to Matplotlib.
- It may not be suitable for creating complex and interactive visualizations.
Simplicity/Complexity:
Seaborn is designed to simplify the process of creating attractive statistical visualizations. 
- Its high-level functions reduce complexity, making it well-suited for users who prioritize ease of use.
Flexibility/Configurations:
In favour of simplicity, Seaborn gives up some flexibility. 
- Even though it has customization possibilities, intricate settings might need to revert to Matplotlib for tighter control.
